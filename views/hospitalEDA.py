if uploaded_file is not None:
    @st.cache_data
    
# In Streamlit, the @st.cache decorator is used to cache the output of a function, so that when the function is called with the same inputs, the results are reused rather than recalculated. This is especially useful when working with operations that are computationally expensive or time-consuming, such as loading large datasets or running complex computations.

# In your code, the @st.cache decorator is applied to the load_csv function:

# python
# Copy code
# @st.cache
# def load_csv():
#     csv = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
#     return csv
# Purpose of @st.cache in Your Code:
# Efficiency: If the file uploaded_file remains the same, load_csv() wonâ€™t need to reload the CSV from disk repeatedly; it will use the cached DataFrame instead.
# Performance: This caching improves performance in Streamlit apps, where reruns occur whenever a user interacts with widgets. Without caching, the file would be reloaded each time the app reruns, potentially slowing it down.
# Reducing Redundant Computation: If users toggle between views or perform other actions, Streamlit re-runs the code. Cached functions ensure that redundant computations are avoided.
